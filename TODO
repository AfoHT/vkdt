# pipeline features

* support forks

# pipeline reuse

* debug/make sure runflags make sense/include all deps

# gui

* detect non-display output
* dt-style sliders (which look good and have more precision)
* support masking/post expose drawings
* wire graph->runflags in a meaningful way!

# cli

* detect non-export output

# params and history

* global buffer of commands (not only params)
* version modules! (for params)
* committed_params to use pool, too!
* commit_params needs nodeid?

# module api

* pass struct with pointers to core so we don't need to re-link
* module to have two connectors:
  - main connection used for graph traversal, shared with node
  - context buffer connection

# modules

* estimate noise from raw (black area + one sample)
* burst mode demosaic/denoise
* clut with linear part: colour matrix
* simple denoising with decimated fisz wavelets

# build

* modules/api.h to include all graph_t module_t node_t connector_t structs so
  recompilation triggers correctly
