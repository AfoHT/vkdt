# how to do basic things in the gui

## views

basic cascade of ui views is:

files <-> lighttable <-> darkroom

you can usually walk the arrows by key accel (enter/escape) or gamepad (`x`/`o`).

you can export your work but don't have to save it.

`.cfg` is saved when you exit darkroom mode or switch to the next image
(backspace/space or L1/R1).

`vkdt.db` (labels and ratings) is saved when you switch folder or exit vkdt.


## rate and label

colour labels `f1`-`f5`

star ratings `1`-`5`

these key accels work in both lighttable mode (on the whole selection) and in
darkroom mode (only on the single edited image).

## hotkeys

can be customised for each view separately in the gui via `settings` ->
`hotkeys`. some keys are special and not in the hotkey system.

`f11` goes full screen

`ctrl+q` quits the application

## imgui widgets

most widgets are stock imgui widgets. in particular, if you want to
type a value instead of clicking, the way to do it is to `ctrl+click`.
