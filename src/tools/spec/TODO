- create both spectra.lut and abney.lut at once
- make sure low res abney is fine?
- linear desat + squished sat for gamut mapping?
- use turingbot's idea for hue angle/wavelength mapping?
- abney to go to D65: adapt to d65 globally instead?
- write rec2020 instead of xyz? can we do *Y/y then?
- saturation:
  - fit ellipses to abney data?
  - some skewed distance to white?
  - optimisation based: distort sat in hue sat map until smoother gradients?
